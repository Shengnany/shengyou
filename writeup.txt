- For me the most challenging part is to design mobile friendly user interface. It is really hard to work only with CSS and HTML. It takes me 3 hours to design this website.
- I added media queries to make my website look user-friendly. In my nav-bar, I hide the menu and used an icon to reference the menu, when the user clicks on it(it is an checkbox input tag actually), the menu will show up.
- I carefully considered the colour selection in nav-bar. The colour I chose matches my overall theme (which is purple-based). The part that I was most proud of was the responsive navigation bar.
- Given more time, I will consider adding more pictures and videos to my website. Also, I may add forms in my website to interact with users. I will also make my website look responsive in a more elegant way,
